# Bank-Marketing
 The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution.  The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required,  in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be (or not) subscribed. 

The project is in intermediate stage. Till now I have done data visualisation, data analysis, feature selection and made one basic predictive model by Logistic Regression. Furher I will try SMOTE oversampling, random under sampling and Tree based models. Also some boosting models I will try.
